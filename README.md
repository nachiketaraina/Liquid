**Idea Title** : VizAudi(Visualize the audio)  
**Idea Abstract** :-  
Speech-to-text is great, but why stop there? There's a lot more to audio than just words. That's where VizAudi(Visualise the audio) comes in! Just upload an audio file, and watch your screen come to life with text and GIFS based on words & sounds respectively.
It detects speech and other sounds from audio. Speech is converted to text, and other sounds (cars, dogs, sirens, construction work, gunshots, etc.) are displayed as images or GIFs. This can be used by people with hearing impairments, helping them not just understand what is being said, but also showing them what's happening around them visually (cars passing by, dogs barking, police/ambulance sirens, and even gunshots). It can also be used to enhance any audio-only form of media by augmenting it with relevant images, GIFs and text.
